# Chatroom exercise

## The Mission
Configure a node server, and make a chatroom to hang out with some friends and more!

### Must-have features

- Make a UI that makes it easy for people to send messages in this chatroom.
- It must be possible to send a message to everyone or to yourself
- Identify who sent the message through a username.
    - Make a local variable and prompt the user to choose a username.
    - Emit this username along with the sent message to keep track of who sent what.
- Make a list to show everyone who is connected to the chatroom.
    
### Nice-to-have features

- Instead of just asking for a username, make a user class with properties such as
    - username
    - password (if you make a login system)
    - avatar
    - font-color
    - ... whatever you want :D
    - ps: don't worry about security
- Make different rooms to join by code
- Make it possible to send private messages to a person
- Add images, emojis, videos, gifs to your messages
- Bring back some features from MSN! (lol)
- Make a login / registration (a bit more difficult)
    - again, security is not a must
- PIMP IT

For the nice to haves, you definitely will need to research the documentation for a lot of them.
